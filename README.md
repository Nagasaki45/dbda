# Following "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis", in python

Python solutions to the exercises of Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, 2nd Edition, by J. L. Kruschke.

## Why?

- This is not a translation of R code to python (as the other resources mentioned below). I try to keep the code pythonic, and use the best available tools.
- It's all in ipython notebook format, with figures and stuff, for better learning experience.
- [My thoughts about the code provided with the book](http://blog.tomgurion.me/writing-a-programming-book-dont-compose-an-utility-library.html).
